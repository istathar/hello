Hello World
===========

This is a simple Haskell project stub you can copy verbatim into your
project as a starting point. It has the necessary scaffolding for you to be
able to run any of:

```text
$ stack build
$ stack test
$ stack exec -- hello
```

You can combine the test and run steps with:

```
$ stack run hello
```

assuming (as is the case here) that there's an executable named `hello` in the
package configuration.

The application stub is in _src/HelloMain.hs_ and the unit test stub is in
_tests/TestSuite.hs_.
